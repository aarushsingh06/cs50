Conditional Statements.
1. Conditional expressions allow your programs to make decisions and take different forks in the road, depending on the values of variables or user input.
2. C provides a few different ways to implement conditional expressions (also known as branches) in your programs, some of which likely look familiar from Scratch.
if (boolean expression
{

}
3. If the boolean-expression evaluates to true, all lines of code between the curly braces will execute in order from top-to-bottom.
4. If the boolean-expression evaluates to false, those lines of code will not execute.
