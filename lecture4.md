Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators
   1.In order to manipulate and work with variables and values in C, we are have a number of operators at our disposal.
   2. In C we can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide (/) numbers, as expected.
      1. int x = y + 1;
      2. x=x * 5;
   3. We also have the modulus operator, (%) which gives us the remainder when the number on the left of the operator is divided by the number on the right.
      1. int m = 13% 4; // m is now 1
   4. C also provides a shorthand way to apply an arithmetic operator to a single variable.
      1. x = x * 5;
      2. Ã— *= 5;
   5. This trick works with all five basic arithmetic operators. C provides a further shorthand for incrementing or decrementing a variable by 1:
      1. X++;
      2. X--;
