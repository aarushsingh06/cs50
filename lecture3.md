Data Types and Variables:
1. Int
   1. The int data type is used for variables that will store integers.
   2. Integers always take up 4 bytes of memory (32 bits).
   3. This means the range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 32 bits worth of information.
2. Unsigned int
   1. unsigned is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types (including int), which effectively doubles the positive range of variables of that type, at the cost of disallowing any negative values.
   3. You'll occasionally have use for unsigned variables in CS50.
3. Char
   1. The chhar data type is used for variables that will store single characters
   2. Characters will always take upto 1 byte of memory (8 bits). This mean the range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 8 bits worth of information.
   3. Thnaks to ASCII, we've developed a mapping of charcters like A,B,C, etc... to numeric values in the positive side of range.
